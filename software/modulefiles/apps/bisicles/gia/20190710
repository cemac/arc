    BISICLES Ice Sheet Model

    BISICLES is a scalable AMR ice sheet modeling code built on the Chombo
    framework and is a part of the Community Ice Sheet Model (CISM). With a
    dynamical core based on the vertically-integrated model of Schoof and
    Hindmarsh (2011), BISICLES can resolve dynamically important regions at
    the sub-kilometer scale while using much coarser resolution where
    appropriate.

    The 'gia' version of BISICLES incorporates glacial isostasy into BISICLES

    PETSc enabled executables are suffied with '.PETSC', e.g.:

      driver2d       : not built with PETSc support
      driver2d.PETSC : built with PETSc support
