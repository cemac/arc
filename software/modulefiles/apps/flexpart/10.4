    FLEXible PARTicle dispersion mode

    FLEXPART (“FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model”) is a Lagrangian transport
    and dispersion model suitable for the simulation of a large range of
    atmospheric transport processes. Apart from transport and turbulent
    diffusion, it is able to simulate dry and wet deposition, decay, linear
    chemistry; it can be used in forward or backward mode, with defined sources
    or in a domain-filling setting. It can be used from local to global scale.
