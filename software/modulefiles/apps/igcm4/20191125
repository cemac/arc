    Intermediate Global Circulation Model version 4

    The IGCM4 (Intermediate Global Circulation Model version 4) is a global
    spectral primitive equation climate model whose predecessors have
    extensively been used in areas such as climate research, process modelling
    and atmospheric dynamics. The IGCM4â€™s niche and utility lies in its speed
    and flexibility allied with the complexity of a primitive equation climate
    model.
