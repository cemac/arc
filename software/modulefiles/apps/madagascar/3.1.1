    Multidimensional data analysis and computational experiments

    Madagascar is an open-source software package for multidimensional
    data analysis and reproducible computational experiments. Its
    mission is to provide

    * convenient and powerful environment
    * convenient technology transfer tool

    for researchers working with digital image and data processing in
    geophysics and related fields. Technology developed using the
    Madagascar project management system is transferred in the form of
    recorded processing histories, which become \"computational
    recipes\" to be verified, exchanged, and modified by users of the
    system.
