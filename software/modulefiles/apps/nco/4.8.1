    NetCDF Operators

    The NCO toolkit manipulates and analyzes data stored in netCDF-accessible
    formats, including DAP, HDF4, and HDF5. It exploits the geophysical
    expressivity of many CF (Climate & Forecast) metadata conventions, the
    flexible description of physical dimensions translated by UDUnits, the
    network transparency of OPeNDAP, the storage features (e.g., compression,
    chunking, groups) of HDF (the Hierarchical Data Format), and many powerful
    mathematical and statistical algorithms of GSL (the GNU Scientific
    Library). NCO is fast, powerful, and free.
