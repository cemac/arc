    NetCDF visual browser

    Ncview is a visual browser for netCDF format files.  Typically you would
    use ncview to get a quick and easy, push-button look at your netCDF files.
    You can view simple movies of the data, view along various dimensions, take
    a look at the actual data values, change color maps, invert the data, etc.
    It runs on UNIX platforms under X11, R4 or higher.
