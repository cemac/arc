    SPECFEM2D simulates forward and adjoint seismic wave propagation
    in two-dimensional acoustic, (an)elastic, poroelastic or coupled
    acoustic-(an)elastic-poroelastic media, with Convolution PML
    absorbing conditions.

    Meshing is based for instance upon Gmsh, Cubit, GiD or a simple
    internal mesher provided with the package, and the
    acoustic/(an)elastic/poroelastic solvers are based upon the
    spectral-element method. The package may also be used to calculate
    finite-frequency kernels and has full adjoint
    capabilities. Convolution PML absorbing conditions are used to
    efficiently absorb the outgoing wave field on the outer edges of
    the grid.
