    Visualization, animation and analysis tool

    VisIt is an open source interactive parallel visualization and graphical
    analysis tool for viewing scientific data. It can be used to visualize
    scalar and vector fields defined on 2D and 3D structured and unstructured
    meshes. VisIt was designed to handle very large data set sizes in the
    terascale range and yet can also handle small data sets in the kilobyte
    range.
